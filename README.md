# Will-a-Startup-Succeed-or-fail-
Business problem: Investment strategies for investing in start-up companies are widely based on intuition or past experience. 
As a result, investors rely primarily on the need being addressed, background of the founders, size of the market being addressed and the ability of the company to scale after tasting early success. 
The question we pose here is, “can we perform some rigorous analysis that can be used to identify relevant factors and score prospective start- ups based on their potential to be successful”. 
This model/ analysis will then allow investors to make more informed decisions and rely less on their intuitions. 
You would need to build a logistic regression model (only) to predict whether a start-up will succeed or fail. 
Furthermore, you would need to focus on the data preparation and exploration part. 
Before any modeling algorithm can be applied the given data needs to be cleaned and explored to make the data fit for analysis and select features for modeling.
